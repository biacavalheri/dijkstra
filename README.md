Dijkstra's Algorithm
This project implements Dijkstra's Algorithm, a well-known algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks or communication links. The implementation is designed to calculate the shortest distance from a source node to all other nodes in the graph.

Key Features:
1. Graph Representation: The graph is represented as an adjacency matrix, which is loaded from a file.
2. Shortest Path Calculation: The algorithm calculates the shortest paths from a specified source node to every other node in the graph.
3. Input File: The adjacency matrix of the graph is provided through an input file, making the algorithm adaptable to various graph structures.

How It Works:
1. Load the Graph: The graph's adjacency matrix is loaded from a specified file.
2. Execute Dijkstra's Algorithm: Starting from the source node, the algorithm iteratively finds the shortest path to each node in the graph.
3. Output: The shortest distances from the source node to all other nodes are computed and can be printed or processed further.

This implementation is ideal for applications that require efficient distance calculations in large graphs, such as network routing, geographic mapping, or logistics planning. The ability to load the graph from a file makes it flexible for different use cases and graph sizes.
